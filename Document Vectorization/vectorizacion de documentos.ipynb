Mirza tossed the ball in anger but the duo failed to win the argument, or the match, leaving Krejcikova and Siniakova to celebrate a memorable victory.It proved to be a bad day for the big names in

Mirza tossed the ball in anger but the duo failed to win the argument, or the match, leaving Krejcikova and Siniakova to celebrate a memorable victory.It proved to be a bad day for the big names in doubles as Venus and Serena Williams, who were the last women's team to hold all four majors in 2010, also perished in the third round, beaten 6-3 6-3 by the Dutch-Swedish pairing of Kiki Bertens and Johanna Larsson.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 666,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1/15/2017\",\n          \"8/10/2015\",\n          \"2/7/2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Heading\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2581,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PIA signs contact lease three A 330s Sri L\",\n          \"Kohli masterclass prompts Tendulkar compari\",\n          \"Pound tests new 31 year low vs dollar\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NewsType\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sports\",\n          \"business\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vector\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def buscar_documentos(documento_original,n):\n","  data = {\n","      'Article':[],\n","      'sims':[]\n","  }\n","  buscar = vectorize(documento_original)\n","  A = buscar\n","  for vector, headline in zip(df['vector'], df['Article']):\n","    B = vector\n","    try:\n","      resultado = np.dot(A,B)/(np.linalg.norm(A)*np.linalg.norm(B))\n","    except:\n","      resultado = 0\n","\n","    data['Article'].append(headline)\n","    data['sims'].append(resultado)\n","\n","    final = pd.DataFrame(data).sort_values(by='sims',ascending=False).head(n)\n","  return final"],"metadata":{"id":"NcB42ocTa8tu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742336229217,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Daniela Dávila Román","userId":"05787483828042315207"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["buscar_documentos('Asiam markets plummet',n=15)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":554},"id":"9hfUeoYhdEnN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742336231688,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2470,"user":{"displayName":"Daniela Dávila Román","userId":"05787483828042315207"}},"outputId":"9e79eaf5-1061-4a27-c1bb-dcab251d11c3"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-12-a0cd72a0ccf2>:11: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide\n","  resultado = np.dot(A,B)/(np.linalg.norm(A)*np.linalg.norm(B))\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                              Article  sims\n","0   KARACHI: The Sindh government has decided to b...

The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.\\\"Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,\\\" analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.\\\"The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,\\\" ANZ bank said.                        \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n          \"HONG KONG: Hong Kong stocks edged up 0.24 percent in early trade Thursday despite a fourth successive day of losses on Wall Street.The benchmark Hang Seng Index added 56.75 points to 24,169.35. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n          \"KARACHI: The Sindh government has decided to bring down public transport fares by 7 per cent due to massive reduction in petroleum product prices by the federal government, Geo News reported.Sources said reduction in fares will be applicable on public transport, rickshaw, taxi and other means of traveling.Meanwhile, Karachi Transport Ittehad (KTI) has refused to abide by the government decision.KTI President Irshad Bukhari said the commuters are charged the lowest fares in Karachi as compare to other parts of the country, adding that 80pc vehicles run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

He is the first Spanish bullfighter to die in a ring since the turn of the century.In the southeastern village of Pedreguer near Valencia, a 28-year-old Spaniard was killed during a bull-run, in which people risk life and limb by racing alongside specially-bred fighting bulls through narrow streets.A bull\\u00b4s horn pierced his lung and heart as he was trying to help another runner during the event, in which a man was killed last year, a spokesman for the regional government said.Many of Spain\\u00b4s towns hold summer festivals involving bulls, and several people die each year.The San Fermin festival, in which bulls chase red-scarved runners through Pamplona\\u00b4s cobbled streets during nine days of events, attracts thousands of revellers from Spain and overseas.In Saturday\\u00b4s run there, a 33-year-old Japanese man was gored in the chest and a 24-year-old Spanish man in the arm, while 12 others suffered minor injuries, the local government said on its website.The Japanese man was in a stable condition in hospital, a spokesman for the festival said.The four-minute run in Pamplona featured six bulls from the Jose Escolar ranch, one of which separated from the rest and caused panic among the runners.The daily bull-run along an 825-metre stretch of narrow streets in Pamplona\\u00b4s old town starts at 8 a.<br/>m.<br/>(0600 GMT) and usually lasts between three and five minutes.<br/>There are eight runs in total during the festival.<br/>Over the past century 15 people have died in Pamplona\\u00b4s event, which dates back hundreds of years, according to a count on the unofficial San Fermin website.<br/>The last death was recorded in 2009.\\u00a0\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

Mirza tossed the ball in anger but the duo failed to win the argument, or the match, leaving Krejcikova and Siniakova to celebrate a memorable victory.It proved to be a bad day for the big names in
