in one more way  they set up a process they know is not going to lead to the presidents removal          it s alienating independents  this president is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another  and that really plays to his base     foxnews   cvpayne their partisan witch hunt is hurting our country do badly    only bringing more division than ever a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty  filthy  cops  politicians  government officials  and an investigation that was illegally started   that spied on my campaign  the witch hunt is sputtering badly  but still going on  ukraine hoax    if this        had happened to a presidential candidate  or president  who was a democrat  everybody involved would long ago be in jail for

general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time  and was plotting to kill many more   but got caught  he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people  including the recent large number        of protesters killed in iran itself  while iran will never be able to properly admit it  soleimani was both hated and feared within the country  they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe  he should have been taken out many years ago the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year  for many years  that is on top of all else we have done for them  the people of iraq don t want to be dominated   controlled by iran  but ultimately  that is their choice  over the last 15 years  iran has gained more        and more control over iraq  and the people of iraq are not happy with that  it will never end well this is a great book  a must read  twitter com

do  pushed back  and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending u s  taxpayer money  there was a back   forth over the legal arguments    the w h  decision was

badly wounded many others  not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime  including recently        hundreds of iranian protesters  he was already attacking our embassy  and preparing for additional hits in other locations  iran has been nothing but problems for many years  let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans  or american assets  we have         targeted 52 iranian sites  representing the 52 american hostages taken by iran many years ago   some at a very high level   important to iran   the iranian culture  and those targets  and iran itself

notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any u s  person or target  the united states will quickly   fully strike back    perhaps in a disproportionate manner  such legal

biden was in charge of the h1n1 swine flu epidemic which killed thousands of people  the response was one of the worst on record  our response is one of the best  with fast action of border closings   a 78  approval rating  the highest on record  his was lowest  the obama white house had to immediately issue an apology for joe biden s remarks  and any alarm that he might have caused  an alarm about a swine flu outbreak that took 6 months for president obama to declare a national emergency  and that killed 12 000 americans     loudobbsfor decades the   cdcgov looked at  and studied  its testing system  but did nothing about it  it would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic  but a pandemic would never happen  they hoped  president obama made changes that only complicated things further          their response to h1n1 swine flu was a full scale disaster  with thousands dying  and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem  until now  the changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis  all red tape has been cut  ready to go if you want to get money into the hands of people quickly   efficiently  let them have the full money
